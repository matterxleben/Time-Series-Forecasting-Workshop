# Time Series Forecasting Workshop

In this workshop, I talk about time series forecasting. I created it as a part of the University of Waterloo Data Science Club. I also made a Jupyter Notebook that codes an ARIMA model.

Here is a link to a video recording of the workshop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67pEgD_oAEc&ab_channel=UWaterlooDataScience
