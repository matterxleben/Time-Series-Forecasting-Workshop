# Time Series Forecasting Workshop

While I was an Executive on the University of Waterloo Data Science Club, I created and presented this workshop on time series forecasting concepts to University of Waterloo students. I also made a Jupyter Notebook that codes an ARIMA model in Python, forecasting a simple time series dataset.

Here is a link to a video recording of the workshop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67pEgD_oAEc&ab_channel=UWaterlooDataScience
